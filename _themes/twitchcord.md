  Twitchcord is a theme created with the idea of bringing Twitch to Discord, combined with a little extra personality.

  Every aspect and element is carefully crafted and themed with both aesthetics and performance in mind.

  **PIXEL PERFECT**
  Each pixel has been meticulously pushed into its proper place. You also may find some animated pixel friends to guide you on your way.
  **FULLY STYLED**
  The animations are really toned down in order to keep performance as high as possible, but the subtleties of the animations present make it worth it.
  **EVER EVOLVING**
  As Discord continues to grow, change, and update, so too shall Twitchcord. Fear not, there is no end in sight for this theme.
